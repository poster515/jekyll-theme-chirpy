## Welcome!

This is my first time blogging in general. I've never been a writer per se, but I've always been curious about things around me and decided it might be time to share little nuggets of knowledge I've obtained throughout the years.

A little about me: I obtained a Bachelor's from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 2014, and a Master's from the Naval Postgraduate School in 2017. Both degrees focused in electrical and computer engineering; however I've begun to pivot more into computer science over the last few years. 

I really enjoy CS because it's such a universal and epistemological endeavor. Anyone can "do" it. You can take it everywhere. And it surrounds us all the time; it's omnipresent. Hiding in plain sight is the work of computer scientists and engineers over many decades. A good friend of mine even argued that everyone should be literate in at least one computer programming language (although I've read articles debating the legitimacy of comparing proficiency in a programming language to being literate in a second language like Spanish or French).

Anyway, this blog will be devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. I make a lot of mistakes and learn best through them. "Learning by a thousand cuts" so to say. Hopefully I can help provoke someone to try something new, or hopefully help someone solve a problem I've been able to overcome. I may enable comments on this platform so others can provide input, clarifications, general heckling, etc.
